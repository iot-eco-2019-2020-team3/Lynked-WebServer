This project is created in context of the lecture “Internet of  Things Ecosystems” at the University of Applied Science Esslingen. It  covers the invention of an own IoT Idea and Application from the scratch  solving a real-world problem. In the design sprints the students learn  about design, implementation (full-stack) and business aspects of  Internet of Things applications. The aim of this project is to provide a Platform for Students and Professors to communicate.
